# Developer`s notes

* If we would run on ASP.NET Core 2.1 we could use the [new HttpClientFactory](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2018/02/28/asp-net-core-2-1-preview1-introducing-httpclient-factory/).
Unfortunately VS 15.6.7, the version I'm using, does not support ASP.NET Core 2.1 out of the box yet.

* I did follow [Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/task-based-asynchronous-pattern-tap).
